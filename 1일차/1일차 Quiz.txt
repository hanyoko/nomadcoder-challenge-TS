JavaScript is a type safe langauge.
-> No

What happens if we run this code in JS:

["hello"]+{hi:1}
-> It will run

What is a runtime error?
-> An error that happens while the code runs

What is Typescript compiled to?
-> JavaScript Code

Is this valid Typescript code?

const kimchi = {
    맛있어: true
}
-> Yes

We always have to specify a type for our variables in Typescript.
-> Yes, else it won't work

How do we set the type of a variable explicitly in TS?
-> const x : string = "hi"
